# Synergy AIVM Threat Model

## Overview
This document defines the security threats, attack surfaces, and mitigations for the Synergy AIVM ecosystem, including runtime, node, and model registry components.

## 1. Assets
- Model manifests and weights
- GPU worker execution integrity
- Node operator credentials
- Blockchain staking and governance tokens
- Canonical execution transcripts

## 2. Threat Categories
### 2.1 Node-Level Threats
- Unauthorized access to provider agent nodes
- Compromised GPU workers injecting incorrect inference results
- Side-channel attacks in TEEs

### 2.2 Network-Level Threats
- Sybil attacks attempting to dominate consensus
- DDoS attacks on registry API or nodes
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on RPC or gRPC endpoints

### 2.3 Model-Level Threats
- Malicious models attempting to exfiltrate data
- Tampered manifests in IPFS/Arweave
- Poisoned federated learning contributions

### 2.4 Blockchain & Governance Threats
- Staking manipulation or front-running
- Governance attacks via vote collusion
- Smart contract exploits (ModelRegistry, EscrowManager)

## 3. Mitigations
- TEE attestation for GPU execution
- Deterministic WASM execution and transcript validation
- Immutable manifest storage with cryptographic verification
- Multi-layer governance with dispute resolution
- Rate-limiting and API authentication
- Continuous security audits and threat monitoring
