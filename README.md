# Synergy-AIVM  

**AI-Native Virtual Machine powering on-chain intelligence and universal interoperability within the Synergy Network.**  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
Synergy-AIVM is the **AI-powered virtual machine (VM)** that forms the computational heart of the Synergy Network. Unlike traditional blockchain VMs, AIVM is designed from the ground up to natively support:  

- **AI-Driven Execution** — Smart contracts that can self-learn, adapt, and integrate AI models directly on-chain.  
- **Quantum-Safe Security** — Post-quantum cryptographic primitives to future-proof all computation and contract security.  
- **Universal Interoperability** — Cross-chain execution, bridging, and messaging without trusted intermediaries.  
- **Scalable Performance** — High-throughput design optimized for both deterministic blockchain execution and AI workloads.

## ✨ Key Features  

- **AI-Native Smart Contracts**  
  Built-in runtime support for deploying and executing AI models directly within contracts.  

- **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**  
  Integration of lattice-based and other PQC primitives to secure against future quantum attacks.  

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**  
  Seamless execution across heterogeneous chains via the Synergy Interop Layer (no wrapped tokens, no trusted bridges).  

- **Gas-Optimized AI Execution**  
  Fair pricing and resource metering for AI workloads, balancing cost efficiency and performance.  

- **Developer-Friendly Tooling**  
  Support for Rust, Solidity-compatible contracts, and Synergy’s own QuantumScript for AI-first development.
